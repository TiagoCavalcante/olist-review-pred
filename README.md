# Olist Review-Score Prediction

**Project 2 for the Introduction to Data Science course at NES**

This repository predicts the customer **review score** (1â€“5 stars) for every order in the public Brazilian e-commerce dataset provided by **Olist**.
The goal is to anticipate buyer satisfaction before the actual review is written.

## ðŸŒŸ Highlights

* **Presentation:** concise Beamer slideâ€‘deck (`presentation/slides.pdf`) summarising methodology and results.
* **Data Loading:** Reads all relevant CSV tables (orders, items, payments, reviews).
* **Feature Engineering:**
  * Numeric â€“ delivery time, cart value, freight, number of items, payment stats, purchase weekday/month.
  * Text â€“ concatenated review *title + message* embedded with **spaCy FastText** vectors (300Â dim) and compressed to **120Â dim** via Truncated SVD.
* **Class Balancing:** Equalises the five star-ratings through undersampling.
* **Models Compared:**
  1. Linear Regression â†’ rounded & clipped to 1â€“5
  2. Multinomial Logistic Regression
  3. Ordinal Logistic Regression (*mord*)
* **Evaluation:** Accuracy, MAE, RMSE and full confusion matrices.
* **Lightweight:** Runs entirely on CPU â€“ no PyTorch / Transformers required.
